# Machine-Learning

This repository contains projects completed as part of a Machine Learning course, covering a variety of machine learning models and techniques. Each project involves data analysis, model building, and evaluation, with reports written in R Markdown (.Rmd).

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Through these projects, I developed essential machine learning skills, including:
- Data preprocessing 
- Model selection & optimization
- Performance evaluation & visualization
- Interpreting results & reporting findings

## ðŸ“‚ Projects & Models Used
The projects in this repository utilize a range of machine learning models, including:
- [Multiple Linear Regression](https://github.com/pweave5/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Concrete-Compressive-Strength-MLR)
- [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/pweave5/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Heart-Disease-Logistic-Regression)
- [Decision Trees](https://github.com/pweave5/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Spam-Detection-Decision-Tree)
- [K Nearest Neighbor](https://github.com/pweave5/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Spam-Detection-Random-Forest)
- [Random Forest](https://github.com/pweave5/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Spam-Detection-Random-Forest)
