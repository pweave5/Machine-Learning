# Predicting Compressive Strength of Concrete

This project aims to predict the compressive strength of concrete samples using 8 predictor variables. The predictor variables are the 7 ingredients used in each sample and the curing time of the sample. To complete this task I use a MLR model, and apply logarithmic transformation to some predictors to create the best model. The data I utilized is available at [concrete sample data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jholland5/COMP4299/main/Concrete_Data.csv).
